Draft a team and play against your friends and coworkers to figure out who can create the best Open Source development team.

# Roadmap

Fantasy GitHub is a brand new idea. As such, we have a very basic plan moving forward:
* Come up with a rule set that will allow basic fantasy GitHub game play
* Hack a proof of concept together over a weekend
* Start a test league
* ITERATE!
