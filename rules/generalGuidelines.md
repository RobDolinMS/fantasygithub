# Leauges
* `Leagues` are made up of 6-12 `teams`, each with a ``manager``.
* All `leagues` must have a ``comissioner``. 
The ``commissioner`` sets the rule options for the league and is responsible for facilitating day-to-day activity of the league including its draft.
* `Commissioners` may create and maually enfoce `house rules` for any `league`. 
This is part fo the fun.
* `Leagues` draft players in snake format, similar to most fantasy sports drafts.
* `Leagues` may choose to do auction drafts as well, but this is not part of our initial software POC

# Season
* `Comissioners` may define a fantasy `season` of 1 week, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, etc.
* `Comissioners` may define a fantasy head-to-head `playoffs`.

# Format
* `Leagues` may play in weekly head-to-head or points format
